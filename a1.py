AI-Generated Problem Set

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Document your original AI prompt below
2. Copy the problems your AI assistant generated
3. Implement solutions for each problem
4. Include comments explaining your approach
5. Test your solutions with different inputs

Remember: The goal is to LEARN, not just get working code!

MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
    I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
    I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover the basics? 
    These examples shouldn't be full programs (that take user input), they should be functions. 
    Please give example inputs/outputs.

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class.

"""
PROBLEM 1: Even or Odd
    Write a function that takes an integer and returns "even" if it’s even or "odd" if it’s odd.
    Example:
        even_or_odd(4) ➞ "even"
        even_or_odd(7) ➞ "odd"
    

Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
