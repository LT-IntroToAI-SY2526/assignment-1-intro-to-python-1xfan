# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

I actually have worked with a bit of Python before! I learned a bit at CS Scholars at CMU. I'm still not too familiar with it so I think this was a nice refresher. Compared to Java, it's a lot more lenient and I feel like there's more functions for convenience, compared to Java, which feels like it just has the bare necessities.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I asked "What does XYZ do" a lot for code that I didn't understand and AI elaborated and explained it to me in a simple way. For example, I asked: "What does the snippet (that you gave) 's[::-1]' do?" and I learned that it reverses a string named "s".

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

I think the most challenging part was understanding the syntax that doesn't have a Java equivalent, like "return s[::-1]" from AI generated problem 2. AI helped me understand what I was looking at when I asked it to explain it.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

I learned how I can use AI as a learning tool, asking for practice questions to help give me direction in terms of what I should learn. This makes sure I actually understand the material, rather than just having AI do work for me and not learning anything myself. A strategy I used was asking ChatGPT to elaborate on things I didn't understand.
